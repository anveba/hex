The game of Hex implemented in Java using JLWGL at DTU. Made by Group 3.

HOW TO PLAY
===========
  - Click on the board to place a tile of the active player's colour. The first player to get a connection from one side of the board to the other with respect to the player's colour wins. If a player's timer reaches zero, they lose. A small amount of time will be granted at the end of a turn.
   
  - Swap rule: Enables the second player after the first turn to swap colours with the first player by clicking on the tile. If the second player thinks the first player made a move that was too good, they can 'steal' the move. 
  
  - While playing a game, the button on the bottom can be used to undo the last move. This does not recover the time used during that turn.
  
  - In 3D mode: Press arrow keys or WASD to pan the camera. Press shift and space to zoom the camera.
